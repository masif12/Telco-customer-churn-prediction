# Telco-customer-churn-prediction
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company, aiming to identify patterns and predict churn using machine learning models. The project achieves an impressive 98.5% accuracy using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

# Key Features
# Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, and outliers, and performed data cleaning.
Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between customer attributes (e.g., tenure, monthly charges) and churn.
Identified key factors influencing customer churn.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered meaningful features to improve model performance.
# Machine Learning Models:

Trained and evaluated multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN).
Achieved 98.5% accuracy with KNN after hyperparameter tuning.
Insights:

Key factors contributing to churn were identified, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
Tools and Technologies
# Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
